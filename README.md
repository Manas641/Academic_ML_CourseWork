# Academic_ML_Project

This repository includes the work done as part of my Machine Learning Course Project, which was a non-elective course in semester 5.

Data: The data used in this project was taken from UCI ML repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SGEMM+GPU+kernel+performance).

I perform the tasks of Data Understanding, Data Processing, Modelling and Evaluation. This project can be technically modelled as a regression problem and Machine Learning Algorithms for regression are used in this work along with other methods like cross validation. It also includes an implementation of the linear regression algorithm.
